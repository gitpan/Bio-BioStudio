=head1 NAME

Bio::BioStudio::RestrictionEnzyme::Store

=head1 VERSION

Version 2.00

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that stores the database handle for a MySQL database full of
restriction enzyme recognition sites - usually corresponding to the sites
found on a chromosome that is being prepared for segmentation.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

There are two required arguments:

    -name       the name of the database
    
    -enzyme_definitions This is a reference to a hash that has
                L<Bio::GeneDesign::RestrictionEnzyme> objects as values. This
                hash can be obtained from the GeneDesign function define_sites.
 
The other arguments are optional:
    
    -file    Path to a dumpfile that is used to quickload the MySQL database.
    
    -create  A flag that causes creation of the database. Otherwise, an attempt
             is made to open a handle to an existing database.

sub new
{
  my ($class, @args) = @_;
  my $self = $class->SUPER::new(@args);

  my ($name, $file, $create, $RES) =
     $self->_rearrange([qw(NAME FILE CREATE ENZYME_DEFINITIONS)], @args);

  $self->throw('No name defined') unless ($name);
  $self->{name} = $name;

  $self->throw('No enzymes defined') unless ($RES);
  $self->{enzyme_definitions} = $RES;
    
  $self->{dumpfile} = $file if ($file);
    
  if ($create)
  {
    _drop_database($name);
    _create_database($name);
    $self->_initialize();
  }

  return $self;
}

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 load

Load the database from the dumpfile (defined during the call to new)

=cut

sub load
{
  my ($self) = @_;
  $self->throw("No dumpfile described!") unless ($self->{dumpfile});
  $self->throw("Can't find dumpfile!") unless (-e $self->{dumpfile});
  my $command = "LOAD DATA INFILE \"" . $self->{dumpfile} . "\" INTO TABLE ";
  $command .= $self->{name} . q{.} . $tblname;
  $command .= " FIELDS TERMINATED BY '.' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' ";
  $command .= "(name, presence, start, end, enzyme, feature, peptide, ";
  $command .= "overhangs, strand, overhangoffset);";
  return _db_execute($self->{name}, $command);
}

=head2 search

Performs a search of the database.

  -name   search by the name field

  -left   a lower bound for the search on the start field

  -right  an upper bound for the search on the start field

  -enzyme search by the id of the enzyme (BamHI, BssSI etc)

Returns an array reference containing L<Restriction Enzyme|Bio::BioStudio::RestrictionEnzyme>
objects.

=cut

{
  my ($self, @args) = @_;

      -offset     => $aref->[11]
    );
  }
  return \@res;

=head2 cull

Removes entries from the database.

  Arguments: a reference to a list of numbers that correspond to primary ids in
      the database; all rows whose primary key is in the list will be removed.

=cut

sub cull
{
  my ($self, $cullref) = @_;

    $command .= join(q{,}, @portion) . q{);};
    _db_execute($self->{name}, $command);
  }
  return;
}

=head2 screen

Marks entries in the database as ineligible (sets the eligible field to "no").

  Arguments: a reference to a list of numbers that correspond to primary ids in
      the database; all rows whose primary key is in the list will be marked
      ineligible.
      
=cut
